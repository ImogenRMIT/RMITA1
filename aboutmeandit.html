<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>RMIT Student Number: s3667801</p>
<p>RMIT Student Email: s3667801@student.rmit.gov.au</p>
<p>My name is Imogen Leaver, I am Australian born, of English, Irish and Scottish decent.</p>
<p>I only speak English, however my sister-in-law is half Peruvian, and is determined to teach me Spanish.</p>
<p>I am currently completing a Bachelor of Business â€“ Financial Planning, having gained recognition of prior learning from a Diploma in Business.</p>
<p>I love riding my bike, going to the beach, travelling (on hold thanks to COVID), my family & considering the environment.</p>
<h1>Interest in IT</h1>
<p>This IT unit is a core subject in my business degree, running two business, I completely understand why IT is essential to understanding & learning about business! It is how we communicate, make payments, receive money, advertise, market our businesses. I am currently in the process of creating an ecommerce website, it has shown me how ignorant I was about IT (& how fundamental it is to an online business). I am keen to understand more & learn through this course, if not to sound less ignorant & to be more self-sufficient with managing this side of business.
RMIT offered the specific degree I was after, my key interest is business, and specifically the financial planning aspect of life & business. Other universities offered similar commerce, accounting, finance, business type degrees, however not one which would provide me with the financial planning angle I was after (& which is recognised by financial planning institution).</p>
I only have 6 subjects to go to complete my degree, I have learnt so much thus far & expect to expand my knowledge of financial and accounting compliance and wealth creation and management.
